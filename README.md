# Exquisite Script
a programming-based variation on the classic surrealist game

Focusing on norns, the idea is for members of the lines community to collectively iterate on a script, taking it in fun, strange new directions with every successive pass. Each installment of the game should be taken as an opportunity to both expand on (or dramatically transform) the script and to educate others on new concepts. 

There are no explicit rules dictating what direction you can or should take with the script, and exploring both `lua` and `supercollider` concepts are fair game. Also `!important` -- one contributor might design a script variation around specific modules or tools, but the next contributor should feel free to steer away from those completely (i.e. a polyphonic sequencer concept for Just Friends could transform into a multi-voice softcut exploration). 

Each iteration doesn't necessarily need to push the script into further complexity (although that's also totally cool). You might be inspired to make a small tweak, and sharing that small tweak may help or inspire someone else. As the adage goes, the best way to solidify what you've learned is to teach it. 

Lastly, the game should also provide us with opportunities to share feedback on each others' iterations.
